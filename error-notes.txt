css
---------------

<link rel="icon" href="/images/icon.ico">
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/styles.css">


'/' mistake before images & css caused me a lot of time;
I was thinking why the new pages weren't loading the css file,
while root page was working fine with that mistake.

I'd checked if in the 'ejs rendering', there was any error,
then I found the href mistake.






database
---------------

const addItem = new List({
  name: new_item
})


await Page.updateOne(
  {name: page},
  {$push: {data: addItem}}
)

await Page.updateOne(
  {name: pageName},
  {$pull: {data: {_id: id}}}
)

The mogodb nested query caused me trouble,
to add, and remove new item inside the nested object







<input type="hidden" name="page_name" value="<%= page_name %>">

This line caused me a huge problem.
I couldn't been able to delete the item from list, 
because, I included this line inside the for loop.

'page_name' was getting count till the loop time,
So, the code couldn't identify the specific page
from which to delete the item.
